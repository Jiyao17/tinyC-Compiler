Prerequisits
================================
gcc make lex yacc 

Steps to run
================================
1.  get into the directory: semantic_analyzer

2.  run cmd: ./semantic_analyzer code.tinyc output >output
    If the executable does not exist, please make using cmd: make
    Test codes should be in the file: code.tinyc
    Outputs about errors are not in the file: output, but in the terminal



if partial points applicable
====================================
Detectable errors:
1.  Invalid statements, like "a > 1;".
2.  Invalid variable definition, like "int a = b;".
3.  Undefined variables. (But all variables are global, including parameters of functions.)
4.  Undefined functions, exclude "printf" and "scanf".

The program can print the AST and symbol table.
To see them in the terminal, run cmd: cat output
Symbol table is in the last several lines, and AST is above.

AST:
    Nodes are named by their productions.
    Children of a node are indented. 
    Siblings are with the same number of spaces.
    Empty node may exists due to some productions.
    Nodes are followed by the number of its children.
    Leaves are followed by its value.

Symbol Table:
    Detect all functions and variables defined.
    Parameters of functions are also included (currently, as global variables).
    All variables are global.
